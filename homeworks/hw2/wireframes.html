					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Website Name: Youtube </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/wireframe_old.jpg" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/wireframe_redesigned.jpg" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of this webiste is for people to click its videos so that they can generate ad revenue. It is intended for people of all ages: anybody with a device capable of accessing the internet can use Youtube. The design accomplishes this by attracting viewers to its videos by having an exciting thumbnail image and descriptive title that describes what the video is about. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> One problem that my redeisgn addresses is how the filter bar takes up a lot of attention from the user, but is not used often (personally). Another problem that my redesign addresses is that there is no option to choose the order in which videos are listed. By making two clickable expandable buttons, filters and sort by, it reduces attention to all of the filters and also provides the option to sort the video listings. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
