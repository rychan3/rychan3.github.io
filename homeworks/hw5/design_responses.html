                I learned about transitions in this article. I was able to gain
                a lot of inspiration and ideas on what good transitions look
                like. I noticed that all of the transitions were very appealing
                to the eye and did not distract but instead directed attention
                to the new view at hand.

                My favorite part of the article was the cryptocurrency "sending
                transaction" transition. It just felt very smooth and well-made.
                It also had a futuristic feel to it, which matches perfectly
                with the concept of cryptocurrency.

                In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were
                your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal
                in a unique/delightful manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another one of my favorite inspirations besides the
                cryptocurrency one was the one about vegetables for the
                easygrow.io app. It provides information about the vegetable in
                a clear and concise manner. It even provides a picture of the
                vegetable so that you know what it looks like, and then some
                details about the vegetable. The transitions between vegetables
                also feels seamless and clean.

                8, because there wasn't any reading but just simply looking at
                inspirations that were appealing to the eye.
