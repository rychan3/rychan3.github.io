                Something that I learned is the optimal speed for interface
                animation. I found out that it should be between 200ms and
                500ms. 100ms is too fast and will barely be recognized, while
                anything longer than 1s would be considered delay and boring for
                the user.

                My favorite part of the article was the explanation of easing.
                Easing makes the movement of the component more natural. It is
                accomplished by accelerating or decelerating, since that mimics
                the actions of objects in the physical world.

                "Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for
                interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms. These figures are
                based on the particular qualities of the human brain."
