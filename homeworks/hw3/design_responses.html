                Something that I learned from this article is that there are a
                series of guiding steps when choosing font type. The series goes
                identify your purpose, identify your audience, look for
                inspiration, choose your fonts, determine font sizes, and create
                a typography styleguide. I found these series of steps to be a
                great guide whenever I need to choose font type.

                My favorite part of this article was when the author was
                describing font sizes. I found it cool how they used ratios like
                the Golden Ratio and the Perfect Fourth. I also loved how they
                gave us a tool (the Modular Scale) to help us determine type
                sizing.

                8, it was easily digestable and was a great guide on how to
                choose font type.
