        My name is Ryan, and I'm a fourth year at UC Berkeley pursuing computer science.
        I fell in love with CS because I've always loved math and puzzles, and I see programming as a puzzle based on math and data that works in the background.
        I love the problem-solving aspect of computer science, and how straightforward and how the logic of code works.
        Backend interests me more than frontend, however I'm still looking to learn frontend as understanding the interactions between the client side and the server side will make me a better overall programmer.
        In my free time, I enjoy watching sports such as soccer, basketball, football and volleyball!

            Something that I learned from this article is how the Twitter app uses bold text to focus your attention on what is important.
            They used bold text on the number of retweets and likes.

            My favorite part about this article is was seeing each app page appear one piece at a time, rather than all at once.
            This gave me a chance to look at each component and think about it instead of being overwhelemed.

            You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product.
