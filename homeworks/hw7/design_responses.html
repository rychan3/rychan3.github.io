                I learned that there are four principles that the Gestalt
                principles are built on. The four are emergence, reification,
                multi-stability, and invariance. These principles describe how
                people perceive visual elements when certain conditions apply.

                My favorite part of the article was the discussion of
                continuity. It makes sense that elements arrange in a line or a
                soft curve are perceived to be more related than elements
                arranged randomly or harshly. As a result, continuity can help
                us interepret direction and movement through a composition.

                Gestalt (form, shape in German) is a group of visual perception
                principles developed by German psychologists in 1920s. It is
                built on the theory that “an organized whole, is perceived as
                greater than the sum of its parts”.
