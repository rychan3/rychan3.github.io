                I learned about what accessibility is in digital product design.
                I also learned that there are potential legal implications for
                websites that are inacessible. Something else I learned that I
                thought was important was to choose the website's color palette
                early, which will pay off in the end and save a lot of headache.

                My favorite part about the article was learning how exactly to
                make a website accessible. A few tips was to add enough
                contrast, don't solely rely on color, focus state contrast, and
                document and socialize color system. I thought these were easy
                to understand and useful tips that I can apply whenever I'm
                creating a website.

                Accessibility in digital product design is the practice of
                crafting experiences for all people, including those of us with
                visual, speech, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities.
